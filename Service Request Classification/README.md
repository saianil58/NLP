The average time between service request submission and fulfillment is 32 days. Thatâ€™s why 1 in 5 service requests fail.

When it comes to fulfilling your service requests, how would you rate your IT department? Any time you submit a formal request for information technology -a new computer, access to an online portal or another service, a new version of a software program or information on how to use it- your IT department should have the ability to plan for these requests, even automate the fulfillment workflow, and give you a positive service experience.

This problem can be addressed using NLP and automate the toughtest job at hand, To send requests to correct team.

The notebook has a deepdive of the implementation and EDA and checking various options, however, DeepLearning works best with NLP.
